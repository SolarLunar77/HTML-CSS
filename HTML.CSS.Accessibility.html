    <h2>In a word: 'Revolutionary'.</h2>
    <p>Final Fantasy VII is called the greatest Final Fantasy game and one of the best in the world. I completely agree. This game's story, graphics (for its time), gameplay and sound are some of the best ever to grace a console.
    <br>
    <p>Let me start with the story. I will only just say the layer of the story but not explain it, the story is too good and I don't want to spoil it for anyone. The name of the character in this game s Cloud Strife and his friends and the total number of characters are 9 although 2 are optional to get. The story is about Cloud, who was a member of the group called Soldier who joined a group called Avalanche and he has friends from Avalanche are in a quest to save the world and if you look at it that way it doesn't sound too amazing but when you see the whole story you will realise it is one of the best you have ever seen and ever will see because these type of stories don't just come every time. The villain in this game is awesome and I will at least say his name, Sephiroth and there is one scene that he will do one of the most touching things and dramatic things I have ever seen in any RPG or any game, and this scene is so touching that you may even cry if you are not strong enough to bear it but I will not say what happens but just know it happens to a person called Aeris is killed. It is even known as one of the most shocking moments in video games. All in all the story is fantastic and never before seen during its time and even now.</p>
